Python tool for http://api.face.com

For now i've just copied API from php version:
 * http://api.face.com/lib/FaceRestClient.php

This is initial release, not tested so long, and methods/params could/should be
change to be tidy.


Info from http://developers.face.com/docs/:
 * face.com provides face detection and recognition technology that you can integrate with your own application.
 * face.com services are offered for FREE with rate limits
 * You can tag and recognize users from Facebook or Twitter. Alternatively, you can train our index with your own set of users in a private namespace
 * Saving Facebook and Twitter tags improves recognition for you and others, and it qualifies you for better rate limits.
 * We process photos from anywhere, so you can mix and match photo sources with user IDs, which could enable you to, say, recognize Facebook users in Flickr photos...
